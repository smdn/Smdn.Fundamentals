# Examples for Smdn.Fundamentals libraries

## How to run examples
Move to each example directory and execute the command `dotnet run`.

If configurations like device settings or other parameters are written in the code, modify them to match your configurations.

## How to modify libraries
Each example in this directory by default refers to published NuGet packages.

You can change the property `UseLocalProjectInsteadOfPublishedPackage` in file [Directory.Build.props](./Directory.Build.props) to refer to a local project by changing it to `true`.
